### Built with

-  HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to center an element within a div using grid property. I also observed that the height property may not always be needed as the height of an element grows with the content.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
}
```


### Continued development

Need to work more on using <div> and centring them. i dont think I go the media query quite correctly lol. Need to work on that too
